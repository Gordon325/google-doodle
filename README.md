# Google Doodle

## Brainstorm Ideas

Harry Potter, Quiditch

Having the search bar prefilled with a quote

When hovering over the doodle HP will zoom by chasing the golden snitch back and forth unendingly. 

The clouds will move indefinately. 

the google logo will fade in and out when hovering. 

Clicking the content bar will change the pre-filled text, however this astheticly pleasing effect renders the search bar all but usable.
